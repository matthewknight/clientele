# ðŸ’± Compatibility

## Great compatibility

Any standard `3.0.x` implementation works very well.

We have tested Clientele with:

* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/?h=openapi#what-is-openapi-for) - our target audience, so 100% compatibility guaranteed.
* [drf-spectacular](https://github.com/tfranzel/drf-spectacular) works great as well, you can see which schemas we tested in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/phalt/clientele/issues/23).
* [Microsoft's OpenAPI spec](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/import-api-from-oas?tabs=portal) has also been battle tested and works well.

## No compatibility

We do not support `2.x` aka "Swagger" - this format is quite different and deprecated.

## A note on compatbility

When we were building Clientele, we discovered that, despite a fantastic [specification](https://www.openapis.org/), OpenAPI has a lot of poor implementations.

As pythonistas, we started with the auto-generated OpenAPI schemas provided by [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and then we branched out to large APIs like [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/openapi) to test what we built.

Despite the effort, we still keep finding subtly different OpenAPI implementations.

Because of this we cannot guarentee 100% compatibility with an API, but we can give you a good indication of what we've tested.
